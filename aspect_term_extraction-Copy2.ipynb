the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).', 'I took it back for an Asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset.', 'In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).', 'However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you are gaming).', 'Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.', 'I HATE this one.', 'They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired

with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it has / it is a snap.', 'I shopped around before buying.', 'I also got the added bonus of a 30\" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!', 'Would do business again.', 'The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.', 'After paying several

the features that I was looking for.', 'I would highly recommend this one to my friends', 'I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.', 'And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro.', 'Also kinda loud when the fan was running.', 'In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge

Quality!', 'The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.', 'I mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).', 'A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.', 'The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.', 'Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.', 'I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.', 'If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.', '*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters, they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is \"on the top of the stack\".', 'This machine delivers.', 'Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both

it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.', 'The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.', 'we will save our money

happen...', 'I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.', 'Sorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.', 'Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.', 'And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.', 'Overall this laptop

good.', 'The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money.', 'Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.', 'As of a couple weeks ago the

service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.', 'It has a 10 hour battery life when you are doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect
